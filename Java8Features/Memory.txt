In java 8, permgen has been removed. Instead of Permgen we are using metaspace
Earilier due to all class load we used to get out of memory exception as permgen was part of heap memory and ther are some limitation of storage
where as metaspace is not part of heap memory, its part of native memory it utilize OS memory

Below syntax used to set the memory utilization for permgen
-XX:MaxPermSize

Below syntax used to set the memory utilization for metaspace
-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize
